# WIP glome

Aims to be a BlingCorp module that handles global menus and HUD in awesomeWM.

To hack on it you need a registrar service running (for example [fildem](https://github.com/gonzaarcr/Fildem) without the shell plugin or [that minimal python script](https://github.com/RafaelBocquet/i3-hud-menu/blob/master/i3-appmenu-service.py)). The registrar service should eventually be ported to lua too.

For more info you can read `NOTES.md` and the code.
